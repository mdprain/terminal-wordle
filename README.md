# Terminal Wordle

Originally made for a university assignment, this version of Wordle is playable right in your very own Linux terminal!

Extra features have been added since my initial version, including coloured output to resemble the official game, as well as better argument checking.

## Install

```
git clone
cd terminal-wordle
make
```

## Usage

```
Usage: wordle [-len word-length] [-max max-guesses] [dictionary]
```

(NOTE: The default dictionary of words is ```/usr/share/dict/words```)
